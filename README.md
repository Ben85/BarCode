## Daily notes
*February 9, 20:21*

- Finally, I successfully connected and authenticated this VPS at GitHub. :)
- I've changed my user.name in `git config` but this is not enough.
- I've changed my user.email and I'll see wether it is enough.
- If you set your "user.name" and "user.email" in your .gitconfig file, your username will be linked to your profile at GitHub.
